# Parameters commonly leveraged here:
# maxTotalDataSizeMB - sets the maximum size of the index data, in MBytes,
#   over all stages (hot, warm, cold). This is the *indexed* volume (actual
#   disk space used) not the license volume. This is separate from volume-
#   based retention and the lower of this and volumes will take effect.
#   NOTE: THIS DEFAULTS TO 500GB - BE SURE TO RAISE FOR LARGE ENVIRONMENTS!
#
# maxDataSize - this constrains how large a *hot* bucket can grow; it is an
#   upper bound. Buckets may be smaller than this (and indeed, larger, if
#   the data source grows very rapidly--Splunk checks for the need to rotate
#   every 60 seconds).
#   "auto" means 750MB
#   "auto_high_volume" means 10GB on 64-bit systems, and 1GB on 32-bit.
#   Otherwise, the number is given in MB
#   (Default: auto)
#
# maxHotBuckets - this defines the maximum number of simultaneously open hot
#   buckets (actively being written to). For indexes that receive a lot of
#   data, this should be 10, other indexes can safely keep the default
#   value. (Default: 3)
#
# homePath - sets the directory containing hot and warm buckets. If it
#   begins with a string like "volume:<name>", then volume-based retention is
#   used. [required for new index]
#
# coldPath - sets the directory containing cold buckets. Like homePath, if
#   it begins with a string like "volume:<name>", then volume-based retention
#   will be used. The homePath and coldPath can use the same volume, but
#   but should have separate subpaths beneath it. [required for new index]
#
# thawedPath - sets the directory for data recovered from archived buckets
#   (if saved, see coldToFrozenDir and coldToFrozenScript in the docs). It
#   *cannot* reference a volume: specification. This parameter is required,
#   even if thawed data is never used. [required for new index]
#
# frozenTimePeriodInSecs - sets the maximum age, in seconds, of data. Once
#   *all* of the events in an index bucket are older than this age, the
#   bucket will be frozen (default action: delete). The important thing
#   here is that the age of a bucket is defined by the *newest* event in
#   the bucket, and the *event time*, not the time at which the event
#   was indexed.
# TSIDX MINIFICATION (version 6.4 or higher)
#   Reduce the size of the tsidx files (the "index") within each bucket to
#   a tiny one for space savings. This has a *notable* impact on search,
#   particularly those which are looking for rare or sparse terms, so it
#   should not be undertaken lightly. First enable the feature with the
#   first option shown below, then set the age at which buckets become
#   eligible.
# enableTsidxReduction = true / (false) - Enable the function to reduce the
#   size of tsidx files within an index. Buckets older than the time period
#   shown below.
# timePeriodInSecBeforeTsidxReduction - sets the minimum age for buckets
#   before they are eligible for their tsidx files to be minified. The
#   default value is 7 days (604800 seconds).
# Seconds Conversion Cheat Sheet
#    86400 = 1 day
#   604800 = 1 week
#  2592000 = 1 month
# 31536000 = 1 year

[default]
# Default for each index. Can be overridden per index based upon the volume of data received by that index.
# 300GB
# homePath.maxDataSizeMB = 300000
# 200GB
# coldPath.maxDataSizeMB = 200000

# VOLUME SETTINGS
# In this example, the volume spec is not defined here, it lives within
# the org_(indexer|search)_volume_indexes app, see those apps for more
# detail.

# One Volume for Hot and Cold
# [volume:primary]
# path = /opt/splunk/var/lib/splunk
# 500GB
# maxVolumeDataSizeMB = 500000

# Two volumes for a "tiered storage" solution--fast and slow disk.
# [volume:home]
# path = /path/to/fast/disk
# maxVolumeDataSizeMB = 256000
#
# Longer term storage on slower disk.
# [volume:cold]
# path = /path/to/slower/disk
# 5TB with some headroom leftover (data summaries, etc)
# maxVolumeDataSizeMB = 4600000

# SPLUNK INDEXES
# Note, many of these use historical directory names which don't match the
# name of the index. A common mistake is to automatically generate a new
# indexes.conf from the existing names, thereby "losing" (hiding from Splunk)
# the existing data.
